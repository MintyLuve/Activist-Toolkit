    <h3><br/>What Is A Feral Cat?</h2>
    <p>The term “feral” means “unsocialized to humans.” Typically, a feral cat will stay away from humans, frequently hiding out during the daytime. Regardless of their level of socialization to humans, cats are domesticated animals. Many people think if a cat is feral, he or she doesn’t get along with other cats. This is not true: the term “feral” relates only to lack of interaction with people, not with other cats.</p>

    <h3><br/>What To Do When A Stray Cat Won't Come Near You</h2>
    <p>If you find a cat that won’t come near you and you are concerned about the cat, the best thing is to put food and water out. You can then develop a relationship with the cat by consistently feeding him or her and if necessary, provide the cat some shelter—and we don’t mean take him or her to a shelter. How? Get creative. Try putting the food in the garage, maybe in the empty doghouse, but if placed in there, make sure no dogs or other animals can trap the cat there if the cat is eating.<br/><br/>The most important aspect is that this cat is fed and has water. Then you can prepare to get a humane trap and take the cat in for spay and neuter. There’s no need to panic, so take it slow.<br/><br/>Many people think cats can fend for themselves on the street, and this is not necessarily true. Cats do need to be fed by humans.</p>

    <h3><br/>There's A Sick Cat In My Neighborhood</h2>
    <p>Many cats “on the street” that look ill just need some TLC. Most cats on the streets that are sick have mange or an upper respiratory infection. These two ailments can look bad but are easily curable without major expense.<br/><br/>For mange, drops of the medication Revolution® on the back of the neck will cure mange quickly. Revolution is a prescription-only, FDA-approved medication available only through a veterinarian and is NOT a pesticide registered by the EPA. Revolution is a systemically acting, broad-spectrum parasiticide that has a well-defined safety profile combined with excellent efficacy. If you order Revolution online from anywhere, especially abroad, you must make every effort to ensure it’s not counterfeit. To do this, contact the manufacturer, in this case, Pfizer, for information—you’ll be asked to provide ID numbers on the box.<br/><br/>For upper respiratory infections, antibiotics may be easily added to food.<br/><br/>Of course, if you can use a humane trap and bring the cat to a veterinarian who is compassionate and experienced with strays, that is always best. If you can’t do that or don’t know anyone to help, please contact us for simple solutions.<br/><br/>Again, please do not bring any cat, sick or well, to the shelter or pound. There is a very high likelihood that the cat will be killed.<br/><br/>For the most part, shelters do not treat ill cats. People sometimes think that if a cat looks bad, it’s untreatable. That is just not true. Simple steps, like those above, save lives.</p>
